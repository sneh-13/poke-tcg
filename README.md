Things ToDo:

    Current Priosrity: 
    - Fix overall website tidyness (all proper logos, card counts, proper subpages, add missing possible pages
    Change homepage banner?, create logo with chatgpt, create better name?)
    - Set up user account login (add forget password feature [use any temporary email])
    - Reseach on how to create a price predicting model

    High Priority:
    - Connecting API and improrting all the cards
    - Create price predicting Machine Learning model

    Low Priority: 
    - Setup price alerts
    - Price History graph (using api)
    - Arcjet (user spamming)
    - Discord API (send discord messeges for prices etc.)
    - Stripe API (for possible paywalled features)
    - Language Switching
    - Japanese Sets
    - Add other login/register options
